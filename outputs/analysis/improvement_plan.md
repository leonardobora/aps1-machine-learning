# N2O Emissions Prediction Model Improvement Plan

## Current Model Limitations

After analyzing the current model (`aps1_fixed.ipynb`) and comparing it with your friend's model results, we identified several key limitations:

1. **Restricted Prediction Range**:
   - Your model's predictions are limited to a very narrow range (0-50.63)
   - Actual values range from 0 to 138,618.63
   - This results in severe underprediction of high emission values

2. **Poor Correlation**:
   - Your model shows correlation of only 0.32 with actual values
   - Friend's model achieves 0.93 correlation with same data

3. **Single Model Approach**:
   - Using one model for all sectors ignores the unique emission patterns of each sector
   - Agricultural emissions particularly have different patterns than other sectors

4. **Time Series Handling**:
   - Historical data not fully leveraged for prediction
   - Limited temporal features to capture evolving patterns

## Improvement Strategy

### 1. Target Transformation

The most critical improvement is applying logarithmic transformation to the target variable:

```python
# Before training
y_train_transformed = np.log1p(y_train)

# After prediction, transform back
predictions = np.expm1(model.predict(X_test))
```

This addresses the range restriction issue by:
- Making the target distribution more normal
- Allowing the model to better handle the wide range of values
- Preventing underprediction of high values

### 2. Sector-Specific Models

Instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, we'll train separate models for different sectors:

```python
# For agricultural sector (higher variability)
agro_model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=200, max_depth=12, min_samples_leaf=5)

# For other sectors
other_model = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.05, max_depth=6)
```

This allows:
- Each model to specialize in a sector's unique patterns
- Different hyperparameters optimized for each sector's needs
- Better handling of sector-specific outliers

### 3. Advanced Feature Engineering

Enhanced feature engineering will capture more complex patterns:

```python
# Temporal features
data['decada'] = (data['ano'] // 10) * 10
data['ano_normalizado'] = (data['ano'] - min(data['ano'])) / (max(data['ano']) - min(data['ano']))

# Sector indicators
data['is_agropecuaria'] = (data['nivel_1'] == 'Agropecuária').astype(int)

# Interaction terms
data['sector_por_ano'] = data['is_agropecuaria'] * data['ano_normalizado']
data['sector_por_ano_quad'] = data['sector_por_ano'] ** 2  # Non-linear interactions

# Domain-specific features (for agriculture)
data['is_animal'] = (data['nivel_5'] == 'Animal').astype(int)
data['animal_por_ano'] = data['is_animal'] * data['ano'] 
```

### 4. Sector-Specific Outlier Handling

Customize outlier detection by sector to preserve important signals:

```python
# Example: Different thresholds for agriculture
if sector == 'Agropecuária':
    # Double the normal threshold for agriculture
    upper_bound = q3 + (threshold * 2) * iqr
else:
    upper_bound = q3 + threshold * iqr
```

## Expected Improvements

By implementing these changes, we expect:

1. **Full Range Prediction**: Model will be able to predict the full range of emission values
2. **Higher Correlation**: Correlation coefficient should increase from 0.32 to closer to 0.9
3. **Better MAE**: Mean Absolute Error should decrease significantly
4. **More Accurate Sector-Specific Predictions**: Especially for agricultural emissions

## Implementation Plan

The implementation is available in `aps1_final_improved.ipynb`:

1. Data loading and preprocessing with better handling of missing values
2. Advanced feature engineering with sector-specific features
3. Log transformation of target values
4. Separate models for each sector
5. Prediction combination and evaluation
6. Comparison with original model

This approach should bring your model's performance much closer to your friend's results, with better accuracy across all emission values.
