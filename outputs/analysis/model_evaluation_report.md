# N2O Emissions Model Evaluation Report

## Executive Summary

The model developed for predicting N2O emissions in Brazil shows concerning performance issues despite using standard machine learning techniques. While achieving an R² of 0.59 on the test set, there are significant gaps between actual and predicted values, especially for agricultural emissions.

### Key Metrics
| Model | RMSE | MAE | R² |
|-------|------|-----|---|
| Random Forest (Optimized) | 12.26 | 8.00 | 0.59 |
| Traditional Cross-Validation | 11.71 (±0.16) | 7.08 (±0.11) | 0.59 (±0.01) |
| Time Series Cross-Validation | 11.85 (±4.45) | 8.17 (±4.26) | -0.06 (±0.12) |

## Critical Issues Identified

1. **Severe Underprediction**: The model consistently underpredicts high emission values:
   - Actual values of 756-828 t being predicted as ~45 t (agricultural/animal sources)
   - Error analysis shows maximum errors of 42.16 t with large systematic bias

2. **Temporal Reliability Problem**: The negative R² in time series cross-validation (-0.06) indicates the model fails to generalize to future time periods.

3. **Feature Importance Imbalance**: Two features dominate the model (nivel_1_Energia at 38% and is_energia at 35%), suggesting the model may be oversimplifying.

4. **Limited Model Differentiation**: All evaluated models produce nearly identical results, suggesting fundamental issues with feature engineering or data preprocessing.

## Recommended Improvements

1. **Enhanced Time Series Modeling**
   - Implement proper time-series modeling techniques like ARIMA or Prophet
   - Add lagged variables and moving averages to capture temporal patterns
   - Separate models for different sectors to address sector-specific emission patterns

2. **Model Architecture Refinement**
   - Test quantile regression to better capture extreme values
   - Implement stacked ensemble of specialized sector models
   - Add polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships

3. **Data Augmentation & Preprocessing**
   - Review outlier treatment (current approach may be too aggressive)
   - Implement logarithmic transformation for the target variable
   - Create sector-specific normalization approaches

4. **External Factors Integration**
   - Consider weather/climate data incorporation
   - Add economic indicators relevant to emission sectors
   - Include policy change indicators as binary features

## Implementation Plan

The next iteration of modeling should focus on:

1. Building sector-specific sub-models (especially for agriculture)
2. Implementing proper time-series techniques with temporal validation
3. Addressing the systematic underprediction of high emission values
4. Carefully reviewing and updating the feature engineering approach

This report highlights critical weaknesses in the current model and outlines a path forward to develop a more accurate and reliable emissions forecasting system.
