# N2O Prediction Analysis

## Prediction vs. Actual Values Analysis

Based on examination of the first few rows of the prediction dataset, we've identified a severe systematic underprediction pattern:

| Sector | Subsector | Year | Actual Value (t) | Predicted Value (t) | Error (t) | Error (%) |
|--------|-----------|------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|----------|
| Agropecuária | Manejo de Dejetos Animais (Aves) | 2016 | 756.91 | 45.42 | 711.49 | 94.0% |
| Agropecuária | Manejo de Dejetos Animais (Aves) | 2017 | 803.02 | 45.48 | 757.54 | 94.3% |
| Agropecuária | Manejo de Dejetos Animais (Aves) | 2018 | 825.93 | 45.51 | 780.42 | 94.5% |
| Agropecuária | Manejo de Dejetos Animais (Aves) | 2019 | 828.42 | 45.51 | 782.91 | 94.5% |
| Agropecuária | Manejo de Dejetos Animais (Gado de Corte) | 2016 | 1327.52 | 46.00 | 1281.52 | 96.5% |

## Key Observations

1. **Magnitude of Underprediction**: The model is predicting approximately 5-6% of the actual values for agricultural emissions.

2. **Consistency of Error**: The error is remarkably consistent across years (94-96.5%), suggesting a systematic modeling issue rather than random error.

3. **Limited Temporal Variation**: Predictions show minimal variation between years (45.42 to 46.07), despite significant annual changes in actual emissions.

4. **Sector-Specific Issue**: The problem appears most severe in the agricultural sector, particularly for animal-related emissions.

## Potential Causes

1. **Scale Normalization Issue**: The normalization process may have compressed the scale of certain features too aggressively.

2. **Outlier Treatment**: The IQR-based outlier treatment may have inadvertently treated legitimate high values as outliers.

3. **Target Transformation**: The model may require a logarithmic transformation of the target variable to handle the wide distribution of emission values.

4. **Categorical Encoding Problem**: The encoding of categorical variables (particularly in the agricultural sector) may be insufficient to capture the emission patterns.

5. **Feature Selection Bias**: The feature selection process may have eliminated important predictors for agricultural emissions.

## Next Steps

1. Retrain the model without aggressive outlier treatment
2. Test logarithmic transformation for the target variable
3. Create separate models for agricultural and non-agricultural sectors
4. Add polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships
5. Implement ensemble methods that specifically target high-emission scenarios
