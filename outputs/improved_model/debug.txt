Problem: Files are being created by the Python script but not appearing in the directory.

Possible causes:
1. File permissions issue
2. Relative path resolution issue
3. Writing to a different directory than expected

Let's add some debug information to track the issue:

Script says:
- Files are being saved to: ../outputs/improved_model/
- CSV file saved with size: 1033339 bytes
- Images saved to: ../outputs/improved_model/figures/

Filesystem checks:
- The directory structure exists: outputs/improved_model/figures
- The CSV file should be 1MB (1033339 bytes)
- The script shows specific figure filenames being created

This debug file is being created to test write permissions in the target directory.
